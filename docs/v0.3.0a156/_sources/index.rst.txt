Welcome to MatFlow's documentation!
===================================

MatFlow is an open source Python framework for managing computational materials science workflows.
It is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to link together existing tools and anlaysis scripts into cohesive workflows, that can be deployed either locally or on powerful HPC systems.
These workflows are described in the form of simple YAML text files, which can be shared and reused to reproduce results.

It was originally developed by `Adam Plowman <https://lightform.org.uk/people/dr-adam-plowman>`_ and is actively supported by researchers at the University of Manchester's CLARI (formerly LightForm) group `LightForm <https://lightform.org.uk/>`_
and collaborators, and at UKAEA. For an example of usage, see Plowman et al. 2023 `DOI <https://doi.org/10.12688/materialsopenres.17576.1>`_.
